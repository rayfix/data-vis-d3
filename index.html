  <h2>Thinking about the climate crisis</h2>
  <p>On December 7th, 1972, during the final mission of the Apollo program, the crew of Apollo 17 snapped this picture of our home planet. Since then, this picture, known as the "Blue Marble" has become the most distributed public domain image of all time. This picture, along with others from Apollo missions continue to serve as a catalyst for environmental awareness as they showcase the beauty and fragility of our planet, and remind us that country borders are mere human constructs. As we think about the climate crisis, we are reminded that it is matter of global significance, not effecting any one country but all of us.</p>

  <h3>Earth as a single pixel</h3>
  <p>As we consider the global significance of the climate problem, there is one more image of our planet that we should perhaps consider.  This image was taken by the Voyager spacecraft at the request of Carl Sagan.  Having concluded its formal mission and being 3.7 billion miles away from Earth, Voyager turned its camera in our direction and took this picture.  Amidst a sea of Gaussian noise, in a sunbeam of deep space, floats the single pixel that is our home. The home of humanity.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here, that's home, that's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived thereâ€”on the mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

<p>The Voyager mission showed not only how unique our climate system is in comparison to the gas giants it studied, but how distant and isolated we are from any other world.  It gives us a sense of humility, empathy and urgency as we look for solutions.</p>

<p>We now turn our attention to what is driving the actual problem: CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
